Zope3 Viewlet Demo
==================

Here are a few samples of using zope.viewlet. It has only been tested
on Zope3.3.0b2.


Install as usual by creating zope3demos-configure.zcml::

  <include package="zope3demos" />

 After a restart, you can access demo pages at:

   http://<z3server>:<port>/@@z3d.index.html

Note
++++

This is an interesting experiment for me, since the scope of the "project"
continues to balloon, creating new challenges as new demos are added. My
apologies for the broken links.
